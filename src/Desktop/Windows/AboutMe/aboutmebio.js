    <br></br>When the pandemic hit, like so many other people, I found myself
    unemployed and left with nothing but time. I used that time to learn skills
    that would take me out of retail and into a real career. I was inspired by
    my husband who is a self-taught front-end developer, to follow down the same
    path and learn all the necessary skills needed to become a web developer.
    For the next year and a half, I spent my days studying HTML, CSS, Javascript
    and eventually React. I first dabbled with Haunted and LitHtml which I think
    helped to give me the basic building blocks that would lead me to React.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>I landed my first freelance gig in August 2021, a local lawyer was
    starting his own firm and needed a simple single page website. For this
    project I decided to use NextJS and Tailwind to create a website that
    surpassed their expectations. You can find the live site at{" "}

    <br></br>When I am not behind a computer screen, I have a lot of fun
    creating elaborate makeup looks for my{" "}

    Besides makeup, I also have a lot of fun cooking up new recipes in the
    kitchen with my husband. As you can tell, I take a lot of pride and joy
    creating amazing things from cooking to coding.
