    -Windows 95--<br></br>I helped start the Phoenix chapter of the offical
    Jamstack meetup. I started to teach myself how to code in the fall of 2019.
    I focused on the basics: Html, CSS, and Vanilla JS. From there I went on to
    dabble with Tailwind CSS, LitHtml, Haunted, and have currently been focusing
    on ReactJs.
